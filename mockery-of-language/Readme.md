# Mockery Example

Example of [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) package for mocking interfaces in applications. If we use structs, it's easier to replace the struct with interfaces and then have dedicate mock structs that can be passed in place of interfaces.

**Note:** Tests are currently failing for this build.

```sh
docker compose up --build

```
