# Custom Errors using Chocolates

A basic example of passing custom errors in golang. This project is just for fun.

```sh
docker-compose up --build

```

##### Sample Output

```docker
chocolate-errors-custom-errors-1  | *main.JustificationError: Stop Snickering Dr.Mars, there's Bounty on your head! - It's Rocher - Ferrero Rocher, actually, and start Lindt-ing your code!
chocolate-errors-custom-errors-1  | If you're looking for candy, no M&Ms found i.e. &main.EmptyError{}
chocolate-errors-custom-errors-1  | Forget Vim vs Emacs, I think I just a saw Dove Twix Reese's arm!
chocolate-errors-custom-errors-1  | Godiva or Ghirardelli? *main.HealthySnacks: Have you tried to eat something healthy instead? Celery sticks are usually good.
chocolate-errors-custom-errors-1  | Nothing fun here. Just a generic error. Ooh! A Toblerone!
```
